# ITS-HELPER
An Unofficial Documentation for the ITS Magic Game Engine
---

# 📌 About This Project
ITS-HELPER is an unofficial but helpful documentation project created for developers who want to learn, understand, and use the ITS Magic Game Engine more effectively.

 Our goal is simple:

👉 Make ITS Magic easier to learn
👉 Provide clean explanations, examples, and guides
👉 Help new developers quickly understand how the engine works
👉 Build a community-driven knowledge base

This project is not officially affiliated with the ITS Magic Engine team — but it aims to help everyone who wants better documentation.

So we decided to create a well-structured guide for everyone.

This documentation will help you:

- Implement scripts and game logic
- Use official APIs with examples
- Avoid common mistakes
- Improve your productivity
